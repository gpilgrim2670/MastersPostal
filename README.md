# Masters Postal

This project deals with the [United States Masters Swimming (USMS) ePostal championships](https://www.usms.org/events/national-championships/epostal-national-championships).  Held every year, ePostal competitors swim for one hour, aiming to travel the furthest distance.  Results are ranked by age group and gender.

## Raw Results

As reported results since 1998 are [available as a .csv file](https://github.com/gpilgrim2670/MastersPostal/blob/master/Postal_Raw.csv) in this repo.

## Value Added Results

Results with [additional calculated statistics](https://github.com/gpilgrim2670/MastersPostal/blob/master/Postal_All.csv) (split times, athlete and club ranking etc.) are also available in this repo.

## Shiny App

A shiny app based on the value added results has been built.  It can be used [here](https://gpilgrim.shinyapps.io/MastersPostalProject/?_ga=2.155632699.1406177177.1619535238-1657862835.1619017959), and the [source code](https://github.com/gpilgrim2670/MastersPostal/blob/master/Postal_App.R) is in this repo.

## Demonstrations

There are several articles on the blog [Swimming + Data Science](https://pilgrim.netlify.app/) that deal with the ePostal and specifically draw on the data from this repo.  They include:
